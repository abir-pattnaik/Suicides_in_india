# Suicides_in_india
This project was done as part of Global Hackathon conducted by Infosys in Bhubaneshwar.The data was collected from NCRB India.For us,this dataset was interesting for us because this is the first time we had used unsupervised learning and although it didn't yield any results it did help us develop our EDA.After a lot of brainstorming it was seen that the methods used in unsupervised learning were not satisfactory and thus we created probablistic model and showcase our results.Outputs can be found in this link -->https://www.kaggle.com/abirpattnaik/hackathon
